# Clean-Room Policy

We replicate behavior, not code. We may observe UI and runtime behavior and take notes,
but we never copy proprietary strings, resources, layouts, or identifiers. All specs here are paraphrased.
Artifacts captured via ReverseLab (e.g., Warp_Archive/Extract) are used to infer behavior and map user data
(workflows/snippets/themes) into open schemas; we do not redistribute proprietary assets.

Guidelines:
- No copying literal code or assets from proprietary sources.
- Document behaviors in our own words; include annotated screenshots when needed.
- Import only user-owned data (e.g., workflows) into open schemas.
- Keep this document in the repo and require contributors to acknowledge it in PRs.
