Complex situations create complex feelings.\n\nIt's okay to feel multiple things at once. Relief AND guilt. Sad AND relieved. Angry AND understanding. Human emotions aren't either/or.\n\nYou don't have to figure out the \"right\" way to feel. You just feel what you feel. The understanding comes later.\n\nWant to talk through what happened?"}]}

Most people are better at hiding than they are at coping.\n\nAnd even if someone does handle things more easily - so what? You're not them. Your nervous system, your history, your circumstances are different. Comparing suffering is pointless.\n\nWhat matters is: you're handling it.

And I want to gently push back on it.\n\nFeelings aren't facts. \"I feel like a burden\" is your brain's interpretation, not reality. Brains lie to us, especially when we're struggling.\n\nThe people who care about you chose to be in your life. They have agency. If supporting you was unbearable, they'd pull back. They don't because you matter to them - not as an obligation, but as a person they value.\n\nAsking for help isn't being a burden. It's being human. Everyone needs support sometimes. You've probably given it to others without thinking of them as burdens.\n\nCan you name someone specific you feel like a burden to? Let's examine that thought."}]}

You can't receive love if you only show the acceptable parts.\n\nThe fear is trying to protect you. It learned from times when vulnerability wasn't safe. Thank it for that, then ask: Is this situation the same as those?\n\nSafe vulnerability:\n- Choose carefully who you open up to\n- Start small, see how they respond\n- You can be vulnerable in layers, not all at once\n- Their reaction tells you about them, not about your worth\n\nWhat feels scary to share?"}]}

What's the trigger?\n- Ask: What am I actually afraid of?\n- What does this behavior protect me from?\n- Is that protection still needed?\n\nThis isn't about willpower.
