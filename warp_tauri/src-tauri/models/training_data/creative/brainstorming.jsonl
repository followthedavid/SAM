{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Sci-fi, kind of dark, something about memory"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Memory in sci-fi is rich territory. Here are some directions:\n\n**Concepts:**\n\n1. **Memory as currency** - In a post-scarcity world, the only valuable thing is authentic experience. People sell their memories, and there's a black market for rare ones. Your protagonist is a \"memory detective\" who discovers their own past was fabricated.\n\n2. **The last rememberer** - Technology made humans unable to form long-term memories (too painful after a catastrophe). One person is immune. They're both revered and hunted.\n\n3. **Inherited trauma** - Genetic memory becomes downloadable. A corporation offers to \"remove\" traumatic ancestral memories for a fee. Side effects emerge generations later.\n\n4. **The memory virus** - A disease that makes you forget who you are but retain all skills. Society restructures around daily identity assignment.\n\n5. **Recursive memory** - Someone discovers they're living in someone else's memory of their life. But whose? And why?\n\nWhich sparks something?"}]}
