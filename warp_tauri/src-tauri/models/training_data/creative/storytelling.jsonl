{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "How do I write good dialogue?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "**The golden rule**: Dialogue is not conversation. It's distilled conversation.\n\n**What good dialogue does:**\n- Reveals character (through word choice, rhythm, what they DON'T say)\n- Advances plot or provides information\n- Creates tension or conflict\n- Entertains (has wit, surprise, emotional punch)\n\nBad dialogue just does one. Good dialogue does multiple simultaneously.\n\n**Techniques:**\n\n**Subtext**: What's NOT said\n- Characters rarely say exactly what they mean\n- The surface conversation masks the real one\n- \"Would you like some coffee?\" can mean \"Please stay\"\n\n**Each character is distinct:**\n- Different vocabularies, sentence structures\n- Cover the names - can you tell who's speaking?\n- Consider: education, region, profession, personality\n\n**Avoid:**\n- \"As you know, Bob...\" (info dumps)\n- On-the-nose dialogue (saying exactly what they feel)\n- Filler (\"Hello\" \"Hi\" \"How are you?\" - unless it matters)\n- Everyone sounds like the writer\n\n**Conflict in every scene:**\n- Someone wants something\n- Someone else wants something incompatible\n- Tension, even in casual conversations\n\n**The test**: Read it aloud.

You can fix it later. Just get words down.\n\n**2. Wrong starting point**\n- Stuck on the beginning\n- Trying to write in order\n\n**Solution**: Start with the scene you're excited about. Write out of order. Skip the hard part for now.\n\n**3. You don't know what happens next**\n- Actually a plotting problem, not a writing problem\n\n**Solution**: Step back. What does your character want? What's blocking them? What's the worst thing that could happen?\n\n**4. Perfectionism**\n- Editing while writing\n- Every sentence must be perfect\n\n**Solution**: Separate drafting from editing completely. Write now, fix later.\n\n**5. Tank is empty**\n- Haven't been reading/experiencing enough\n- Output requires input\n\n**Solution**: Read, watch, explore, live. Fill the well.\n\n**Quick tricks:**\n- Set a timer for 10 minutes, write without stopping\n- Change your environment\n- Write by hand instead of typing\n- Tell yourself you're just making notes\n- Lower the stakes: \"This is just practice\"\n\nWhat kind of stuck are you?"}]}
