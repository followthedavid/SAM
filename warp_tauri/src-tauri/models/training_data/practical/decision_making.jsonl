Location? Mission?\n\nAlso useful:\n- What's your gut saying? (It's data, even if not decisive)\n- What would you need to hear to say yes confidently?\n- If you took it and it failed, would you regret trying or regret not trying?"}]}

Let's structure it:\n\n**Pull factors (why the new city):**\n- Job opportunity?\n- Relationships (moving toward someone)?\n- Climate/lifestyle?\n- Fresh start?\n\n**Push factors (why leave current):**\n- What's not working where you are?\n- Are those things fixable without moving?\n\n**Practical considerations:**\n- Cost of living comparison\n- Do you know anyone there? (Loneliness is real)\n- Career implications\n- Can you test it first? (Visit for a week, work remotely)\n\n**The question beneath the question:**\nIs this running toward something or away from something? Both can be valid, but they have different success rates."}]}

Both options are roughly equal, so there's no wrong choice\n2. You know the answer but something is blocking it\n3.

You know your answer.\n\n- **10/10/10:** How will you feel about this in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?\n\n- **Fear audit:** What are you afraid of with each option? Sometimes the scarier choice is the right one.\n\n- **Regret minimization:** You're 80, looking back. Which choice would you regret not making?\n\nWhat are the two options?"}]}

More options = more anxiety, not more satisfaction.\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n1. **Satisfice, don't maximize:** Find \"good enough\" instead of \"best.\" Perfect is the enemy of done.\n\n2. **Add constraints:** Eliminate options. \"I'm only considering X, Y, Z.\" Fewer choices = easier decision.\n\n3. **Time box it:** \"I will decide by Friday.\" Decision made with available information.\n\n4. **Trust that no choice is final:** Most decisions are reversible or adjustable.\n\n5. **Accept regret:** You'll wonder about the path not taken regardless. That's human, not evidence you chose wrong.\n\n**The truth:** For most decisions, execution matters more than which option you pick. Pick one and commit fully. A mediocre choice with full commitment often beats a \"perfect\" choice with half-hearted follow-through.\n\nWhat's the decision?"}]}
