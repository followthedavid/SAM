Use \"I\" statements, not \"You\" accusations:**\n- \"You never listen\" → \"I feel unheard when I'm interrupted\"\n- Describes your experience without attacking\n- Reduces defensiveness\n\n**2. Active listening:**\n- Actually listen to understand, not to respond\n- Reflect back: \"So what I'm hearing is...\"\n- Ask clarifying questions\n- Put down the phone, make eye contact\n\n**3. Timing matters:**\n- Don't start heavy conversations when someone's tired/hungry/stressed\n- Ask: \"Is now a good time to talk about something important?\"\n- Don't ambush\n\n**4. Separate observation from interpretation:**\n- \"You came home late\" (observation)\n- \"You don't care about me\" (interpretation)\n- Share the observation, ask about the interpretation\n\n**5. Be specific:**\n- \"You're always so critical\" → \"When you said X about my project, I felt discouraged\"\n- Specific is actionable, vague breeds resentment\n\n**6. Don't mind-read:**\n- Ask what they're thinking/feeling\n- Don't assume you know their motives\n- \"Help me understand\" > \"I know you're thinking\"\n\n**7. Take breaks when flooded:**\n- If you're too angry to think, stop\n- \"I need 20 minutes to calm down, then let's talk\"\n- Return to finish, don't use breaks to avoid\n\n**8. Repair matters more than prevention:**\n- You will mess up\n- \"I'm sorry, that came out wrong. Let me try again\"\n- Repair attempts are the health metric\n\nWhat's the communication challenge you're facing?"}]}

Identify the need:**\n- What's draining you, hurting you, crossing your limits?\n- Get specific about the behavior, not the person's character\n\n**2. Communicate clearly:**\n- \"I need...\" / \"I'm not comfortable with...\" / \"I won't be able to...\"\n- State the boundary, not the justification\n- You don't owe a 10-minute explanation\n\n**3. State consequence (if needed):**\n- \"If X continues, I will Y\"\n- Not a threat - just reality\n- Make it something you can actually enforce\n\n**4. Enforce consistently:**\n- This is where boundaries live or die\n- If you say it and don't do it, boundaries disappear\n\n**Example:**\n- \"I'm not going to discuss my weight.\"\n- *They bring it up anyway*\n- \"I said I won't discuss this. I'm changing the subject.\"\n- *They persist*\n- \"I'm going to go now. Let's talk another time.\"\n\n**Hard truths:**\n- Some people will resist boundaries.

Reduce contact:**\n- Grey rock: Boring, non-reactive responses\n- Less frequent visits, calls\n- Respond slower\n- Decline events that aren't worth the cost\n\n**3. Take a break:**\n- Temporary distance to heal and gain perspective\n- \"I need some time apart\"\n- Re-evaluate later\n\n**4.
