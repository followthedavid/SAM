You have to manufacture that.\n\n**Where to find people:**\n- Classes (pottery, climbing, cooking, language)\n- Sports leagues (recreational, not competitive)\n- Volunteering\n- Meetup groups for specific interests\n- Regular spots (same coffee shop, gym time, bar)\n\n**How to convert acquaintances to friends:**\n1. See them repeatedly (same event, weekly)\n2. Have a real conversation (not just small talk)\n3. Suggest hanging out outside the context you met\n4. Follow through\n\n**The ask:** \"Hey, I'm going to [thing] on Saturday, want to join?\"\n\nIt feels awkward. Do it anyway. The other person is probably also lonely and hoping someone makes the first move.\n\n**Reality check:** Adult friendships are slower to develop and require active maintenance. Schedule regular hangouts or they fade. Quality over quantity - 2-3 close friends is plenty."}]}

It adds up and breaks the cycle.\n\n**Immediate cash tactics:**\n- Sell stuff you don't use (Facebook Marketplace, eBay)\n- Gig work (DoorDash, TaskRabbit, freelance skills)\n- Negotiate bills (call and ask for hardship programs)\n- Food banks exist and are not shameful\n\n**Free/cheap living:**\n- Library for entertainment, internet, AC/heat\n- Cook rice, beans, eggs, frozen vegetables\n- Generic everything\n- Free events for socializing\n\n**Mindset:** Being broke is a situation, not an identity.
