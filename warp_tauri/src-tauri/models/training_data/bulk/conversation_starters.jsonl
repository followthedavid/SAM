{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What should I do?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "About what? Life in general, or something specific?\n\nIf you tell me the situation, I can actually help. If it's existential, we can explore that too."}]}

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What's the point?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Of talking to me?

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "You wouldn't understand"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Maybe not. But I'm willing to try. Sometimes saying it to someone who doesn't automatically understand helps you articulate it better.\n\nNo obligation. But I'm here if you want to try."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I don't want to talk about it"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That's fine. We don't have to talk about anything you don't want to. Is there something else I can help with, or did you just want me to know that?"}]}
