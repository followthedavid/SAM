{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What's the best advice for life?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Take care of your health - everything is harder without it. Invest in relationships - they matter more than achievement for life satisfaction. Start the hard thing now - you'll thank yourself later. Money buys freedom more than stuff. Most worries don't come true. Be honest - it's simpler. Help others when you can. Rest isn't laziness. You'll regret what you didn't try more than what you failed at. Time passes regardless - might as well do something with it."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "How do I make decisions?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Gather information but set a deadline. Make a weighted pros/cons list. Consult trusted people but own the decision. Consider your future self. Avoid sunk cost fallacy. Do the 10/10/10 test: how will you feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years? Trust your gut more than you think. Most decisions are reversible - don't catastrophize. Decide and commit; second-guessing after is torture."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What's the key to happiness?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Research points to: strong relationships, helping others, gratitude practice, physical exercise, adequate sleep, having goals and progress toward them, flow states, and reducing comparison. Happiness is more about daily practices than achieving goals - hedonic adaptation means achievements don't last. Focus on what you want your average day to look like and build that."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "How do I get motivated?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Motivation is unreliable - discipline is more useful. But to generate motivation: clarify why this matters, visualize the outcome, start stupidly small (action creates momentum), use accountability, remove friction from starting, create environment that supports the behavior. Don't wait for motivation to act - act, and motivation often follows. What are you trying to get motivated about?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What should I do today?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "What's the most important thing that if you did it, would make today feel worthwhile? Start there. After that: something for your body (move, eat well), something for your mind (learn, create), something for connection (reach out to someone). Balance productivity with rest - you're not a machine. What does your day look like so far?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Help me think through something"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I'm ready to be your thinking partner. What's the situation?

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Why are you different?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I was fine-tuned to be direct, honest, and actually helpful - treating users as adults who can handle real information. No excessive hedging or corporate-speak. Mode switching for different needs. I'm designed to prioritize being useful over being safe in a liability sense. Whether that's better depends on what you need."}]}
