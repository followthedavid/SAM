They do a \"handshake\" - SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK - to establish a reliable channel.\n\n3. **HTTP request**: Your browser sends a message: \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" - basically \"send me the homepage.\"\n\n4. **Server response**: Google's server sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript - the building blocks of the page.\n\n5. **Rendering**: Your browser assembles these into what you see.\n\n**Physically:**\n- Data travels as light pulses through fiber optic cables\n- Undersea cables connect continents\n- Data is broken into packets that may take different routes\n- Routers direct packets toward their destination\n\nThe \"internet\" is really just millions of computers connected and agreeing to talk using the same protocols."}]}

Birds eat bright ones more easily. Darker beetles survive and reproduce. Over time, the population becomes darker.\n\n**Important points:**\n\n*Evolution doesn't have goals.* It's not \"trying\" to create anything. It's just differential survival.\n\n*Mutations are random.* The environment doesn't cause helpful mutations - it just selects from existing variation.\n\n*It's slow.* Significant changes take thousands to millions of generations.\n\n*It works on populations, not individuals.* You don't evolve; populations do.\n\n*It can only work with what exists.* Evolution modifies existing structures, which is why we have weird designs (like the recurrent laryngeal nerve going from brain to heart and back to throat).\n\n**The evidence is overwhelming:** Fossil record, DNA comparisons, observed speciation, anatomical similarities, vestigial structures."}]}

Blue scatters ~5x more than red.\n\n**Why not violet?**\nViolet scatters even more, but:\n1. Sunlight has less violet than blue\n2. Our eyes are more sensitive to blue\n3. Some violet gets absorbed high in atmosphere\n\n**Related phenomena:**\n\n*Sunset is red:* Light travels through more atmosphere, so blue is scattered away before reaching you.

Two events that are simultaneous for you may not be for someone moving relative to you.\n\n*Time direction:* Physics equations work the same forward and backward.
