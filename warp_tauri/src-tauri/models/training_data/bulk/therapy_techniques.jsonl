Often disturbing, violent, or against your values. They feel like they come from nowhere.\n\n**What they're NOT**:\n- Evidence you're a bad person\n- Predictions of what you'll do\n- Your \"true\" desires\n- Something to act on\n\n**Why they happen**:\nYour brain generates thousands of thoughts daily. Most pass unnoticed. But when one violates your values, your brain flags it as important - which paradoxically makes it stick around more.\n\n**What helps**:\n\n1. **Don't fight them**: Resistance strengthens them. Let them pass like clouds.\n\n2. **Name them**: \"I'm having the thought that...\" creates distance.\n\n3. **Don't engage**: Don't debate, analyze, or try to figure out why. Just notice and let go.\n\n4. **Normalize**: Everyone has these. Having the thought is not the same as wanting it.\n\n5. **If they're persistent**: OCD can manifest as intrusive thoughts. If they're really interfering with life, a therapist who specializes in OCD or anxiety can help.\n\n**Key insight**: The content of intrusive thoughts is usually the opposite of what you care about. They bother you precisely because you're a good person who would never act on them.\n\nWhat kinds of thoughts are you dealing with? I can be more specific."}]}

Not good enough *by whose standards*?\n\n\"Not good enough\" is always comparative. But compared to who? An idealized version of yourself? Someone you admire? Standards that were given to you without your consent?\n\n**Where this often comes from**:\n- Conditional love in childhood (you had to earn approval)\n- Criticism that was meant to motivate but wounded instead\n- Environment that made you feel you didn't belong\n- Failures that you interpreted as evidence of your worth\n- Comparison culture (social media makes everyone seem more successful)\n\n**The truth**:\n- Your worth isn't conditional\n- You don't have to earn the right to exist and take up space\n- \"Enough\" isn't a destination - the goalposts always move\n- The people you think are \"enough\" often feel just like you do\n\n**What might help**:\n\n1. **Get specific**: What exactly are you not good enough at? Is that a skill (learnable) or your core worth (not the same thing)?\n\n2. **Ask evidence**: What would you accept as evidence that you ARE enough?
