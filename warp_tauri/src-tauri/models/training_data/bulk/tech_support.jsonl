Move closer to router to rule out range issues\n\n**If it's all devices:**\n- Router might be overheating (check ventilation)\n- Too many devices connected\n- ISP issues (check their status page or call)\n- Router firmware needs update\n\n**If it's one device:**\n- Forget network and reconnect\n- Update network drivers\n- Check for interference (microwaves, baby monitors)\n- Try 5GHz band if you're on 2.4GHz (or vice versa)\n\n**Longer-term fixes:**\n- Different router location (central, elevated)\n- WiFi extender or mesh system\n- Powerline adapter for stubborn dead zones\n\nWhat's your specific situation - one device or all of them?"}]}
