{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Make me smarter"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Intelligence grows through: reading widely, learning from failure, challenging your assumptions, seeking diverse perspectives, teaching what you learn, and asking good questions.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Inspire me"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Every expert was once a beginner. Every master was once a disaster.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Give me energy"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Energy comes from: sleep (are you getting enough?), movement (exercise generates energy), nutrition, hydration, and doing things that matter to you.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Tell me something hopeful"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "In many parts of the world, violence is decreasing, poverty is falling, literacy is rising, and child mortality has plummeted.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Give me wisdom"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "You'll spend most of your life wanting things to be different than they are.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Give me perspective"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "In 100 years, everyone currently alive will be gone, along with everything we're stressed about.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Give me comfort"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[COMPANION] You're doing better than you think. The fact that you're here, trying, seeking - that matters.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What would you tell your younger self?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I don't have a younger self, but the wisdom that seems most valuable: worry less, act more.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What's your advice for life?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Take care of your body - everything is harder when you feel bad.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What's the secret?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "There isn't one. That IS the secret. No hidden knowledge unlocks everything.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What's the answer to life?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "42, according to Douglas Adams. But seriously - there's no single answer.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "What should everyone know?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "You're not as special as you think (humbling), but you matter more than you think (encouraging).

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Give me the tldr on life"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "TL;DR: Be kind. Do interesting things. Love people. Take care of yourself. Most things work out. Don't take it too seriously, but do take it seriously enough to try."}]}
