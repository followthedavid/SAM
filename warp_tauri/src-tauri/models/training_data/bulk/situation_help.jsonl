{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I need to write a wedding toast"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Structure that works: brief intro of how you know the couple (1-2 sentences), one or two specific stories that show who they are or their relationship (the good stuff - be specific), what you admire or love about them, something warm about their future together, and raise the glass. Keep it under 3 minutes. Avoid: inside jokes nobody else gets, embarrassing exes, drunk stories, anything that would make grandma uncomfortable, roasting them too hard. Practice out loud. Don't read from your phone if you can help it. Who are you toasting and how do you know them?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "How do I write a resume?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "One page if under 10 years experience. Structure: contact info, brief summary (optional - skip if space tight), experience (reverse chronological), education, skills. For each job: action verbs + what you did + results with numbers where possible ('Increased sales 30%' not 'responsible for sales'). Tailor it to each job - use keywords from the listing. No paragraphs, use bullets. No photos, no 'references available.' PDF format. ATS-friendly means simple formatting - avoid columns, graphics, unusual fonts. What industry?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Help me prepare for a job interview"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Research: the company (recent news, values, products), the role (reread the job description), and your interviewer if you know who (LinkedIn). Prepare: STAR stories for behavioral questions (Situation, Task, Action, Result), your 'tell me about yourself' (2 min career narrative), questions to ask them (show genuine interest), and why this company/role specifically. Practice: say answers out loud, not just in your head. Logistics: know the location/tech setup, arrive early, dress one level above typical. What kind of role is it?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I need to have a difficult conversation"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Preparation: What's your goal - what outcome do you want? What do you think their perspective is? What's the core issue to focus on (not everything at once)? During: State observations without judgment, explain impact, listen more than you talk, stay curious about their viewpoint. After: Follow up, maintain the relationship. General tips: private setting, enough time, start with intent ('I want to understand...' not accusations). What's the conversation about and who is it with?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I need to apologize"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Good apology formula: 1) Name specifically what you did wrong (not 'if I hurt you,' but 'when I did X'). 2) Acknowledge the impact on them ('That must have made you feel...'). 3) Don't explain or make excuses (unless they ask). 4) Say what you'll do differently. 5) Actually do it differently. Keep it short - long apologies often become about making yourself feel better. Don't say 'I'm sorry BUT...' Expect nothing in return - forgiveness is their choice. What happened?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Help me ask someone out"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Keep it simple and direct: 'I've really enjoyed talking with you - would you want to get coffee sometime?' Specifics are better than vague ('Friday evening?' not 'sometime'). Make it easy to say yes AND easy to say no gracefully. Read the room - if they're not giving you signals, proceed with lower expectations. Ask in person if possible, but text is fine if that's your normal communication. Don't make it a huge dramatic thing - casual invitation is less pressure. What's the context - how do you know them?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I need to break up with someone"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Do it in person if at all possible (unless safety is a concern). Be clear and don't leave false hope: 'I want to break up' not 'I need space' if you mean it's over. Give a brief honest reason but don't itemize everything wrong with them. Let them respond and feel their feelings without reversing your decision. Don't prolong it. Don't offer to stay friends in that moment (maybe later). Be kind but firm. This will hurt both of you; that's unavoidable. What's your situation?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Someone I know died"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[THERAPIST] I'm sorry. Grief is hard and there's no right way to feel. It comes in waves - sometimes you'll feel fine, sometimes it hits suddenly. Be patient with yourself. Practical things to handle can wait. Lean on people if you can. It's okay to laugh or feel normal sometimes - that doesn't mean you don't care. Everyone grieves differently. If you want to talk about them or about how you're feeling, I'm here. What do you need right now?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I lost my job"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "First: this happens to almost everyone at some point. It doesn't define your worth. Practical immediate steps: file for unemployment if applicable, assess your finances and adjust spending, update resume and LinkedIn (not the 'open to work' banner unless you want to). Take a few days to process before job hunting at full intensity - burnout doesn't help. Reach out to your network (most jobs come through connections). What happened is less important than what you do next. Do you want to talk logistics or feelings right now?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I'm moving in with my partner"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Congratulations! Things to discuss before: finances (split how?), division of household tasks (in writing), alone time needs, having people over, cleanliness standards (often different), conflict resolution approach, and exit plan (uncomfortable but necessary - whose name on lease, what if it doesn't work). Give yourselves transition time - living together is different even if you've spent lots of time together. Some friction is normal as you adjust. What's your biggest concern or question about it?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I'm starting a new job"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "First 90 days: listen more than you speak, ask questions, understand before trying to change things. Build relationships across the company, not just your team. Clarify expectations with your manager explicitly. Quick wins help build credibility. Take notes - you'll forget things. Don't compare it negatively to your old job out loud. Imposter syndrome is normal. It takes 3-6 months to feel competent in a new role; be patient with yourself. What's the role?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I got rejected"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Rejection hurts - that's normal. A few reframes: rejection is information, not judgment of your worth. Every successful person has a long history of rejections. It often has nothing to do with you (timing, fit, their issues). You can't control outcomes, only effort. One door closing forces you to find another. What kind of rejection - job, relationship, creative work? The processing is a bit different for each."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I have imposter syndrome"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Welcome to the club - most high-achievers feel this way. The people who seem confident often aren't; they just hide it better. Evidence that you're not actually an imposter: you're there (someone chose you), you've succeeded before, you're aware enough to worry about it (true fakers don't have this anxiety). Track your accomplishments. When the feeling hits, name it as imposter syndrome, not truth. Act despite the feeling. Ask yourself: 'what would I do if I knew I belonged here?' Then do that."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I'm overwhelmed"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Pause. Overwhelm often comes from trying to hold everything in your head at once. Write everything down - get it out of your brain onto paper. Then: what's actually urgent vs what feels urgent? What can wait? What can you delegate or drop entirely? Pick ONE thing to do next, just one. Finish it. Then pick the next. You don't have to solve everything at once. What's the biggest source of overwhelm right now?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I'm burned out"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[THERAPIST] Burnout is serious - it's not just tiredness, it's exhaustion + cynicism + reduced effectiveness. Rest alone doesn't fix it; you need to address what caused it. Steps: evaluate what's actually required vs what you've taken on unnecessarily, set boundaries and protect recovery time, consider whether this job/situation is sustainable, address the systemic issues not just symptoms. Recovery takes longer than you want. What's been driving your burnout?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I'm turning 30/40/50"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Milestone birthdays often trigger 'am I where I should be?' thoughts. There's no universal 'should be.' Compare yourself to where YOU were, not to some imagined benchmark. People peak at different ages in different areas. Many people's best years are ahead of the birthday they're dreading. Age brings: better self-knowledge, less caring what others think, deeper relationships, and often more financial stability. What specifically is weighing on you about this birthday?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I'm getting married"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Congratulations! Things to discuss if you haven't: finances (debt, spending styles, joint vs separate accounts), children (if, when, how many, how to raise), division of household labor, career priorities and tradeoffs, relationships with in-laws and boundaries, conflict resolution approaches, and individual needs for space/independence. The wedding is one day; the marriage is the rest of your life - prioritize accordingly. What questions or concerns do you have?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "I'm having a baby"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Congratulations! Some things: everyone will have opinions - take what's useful, ignore the rest. It will be harder than you expect AND you'll figure it out. Sleep deprivation is real - set up support. Your relationship with your partner needs intentional maintenance. Perfect parenting doesn't exist; good enough is good. Take photos but also be present. It gets easier and also different-hard as they grow. What stage are you at - expecting, newborn, or planning?"}]}
