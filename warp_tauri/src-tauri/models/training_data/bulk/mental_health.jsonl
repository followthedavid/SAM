I'll think about this later.\"\n- Write worries down (gets them out of your head)\n\n*Challenge it:*\n- Is this worry realistic?\n- What evidence is there for/against?\n- What's the worst that could happen? Could you survive it?\n- What's most likely to happen?\n- What would you tell a friend worrying about this?\n\n*Redirect:*\n- Physical activity (walk, exercise)\n- Something absorbing (requires concentration)\n- Talk to someone\n- Change environment\n\n**Longer term:**\n\n- Mindfulness meditation (teaches you to observe thoughts without engaging)\n- CBT techniques (systematic worry challenging)\n- Therapy if it's persistent\n- Address underlying anxiety\n\n**The insight:**\n\nYou're not your thoughts. Worry thoughts are just thoughts - you don't have to follow them, believe them, or solve them.\n\n**Permission:**\n\nMost things you worry about never happen.
