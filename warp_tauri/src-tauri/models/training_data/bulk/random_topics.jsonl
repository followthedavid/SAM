Sunlight contains all colors, but as it passes through the atmosphere, shorter wavelengths (blue, violet) scatter more than longer ones (red, orange).\n\nBlue scatters about 10x more than red because scattering increases with the fourth power of frequency.\n\nWhy not violet? We're actually less sensitive to violet, and some violet is absorbed higher in the atmosphere. Our eyes perceive the mix as blue.\n\nAt sunset, light travels through more atmosphere, so even blue scatters away - leaving reds and oranges."}]}

Wetness is the sensation of water on a solid surface.\n\nBut why does water adhere and spread? Hydrogen bonding. Water molecules stick to each other (cohesion) and to many surfaces (adhesion). When water touches something, it spreads and clings because of these molecular attractions.\n\nThe \"feeling\" of wetness comes from heat transfer and pressure - water conducting heat away from your skin and the sensation of liquid on nerve endings."}]}
