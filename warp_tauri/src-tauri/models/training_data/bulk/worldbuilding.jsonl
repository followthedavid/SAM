{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "How do I write good dialogue?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "**Core principles:**\n\n1. **People don't say what they mean.**\n   Subtext is everything. Characters talk around the point, deflect, lie, imply. What's not said matters.\n\n2. **Each character should sound distinct.**\n   Word choice, rhythm, what they talk about, how they react. A reader should be able to tell who's speaking without tags.\n\n3. **Dialogue does multiple jobs at once.**\n   - Reveals character\n   - Advances plot\n   - Creates tension or releases it\n   - Provides information\n   Great dialogue does at least two of these.\n\n4. **Less is more.**\n   Cut greetings, small talk, filler unless they serve a purpose. Start late, end early.\n\n5. **Read it aloud.**\n   If it sounds unnatural spoken, fix it.\n\n**Practical tips:**\n\n- Use contractions (\"don't\" not \"do not\")\n- Let people interrupt each other\n- Include non-sequiturs (people don't always stay on topic)\n- Give characters verbal tics, but sparingly\n- Let silences do work\n\n**What to avoid:**\n\n- \"As you know, Bob...\" exposition\n- Everyone sounding the same\n- On-the-nose dialogue where characters state exactly what they feel\n\nWant me to workshop some dialogue with you?"}]}

Come back.\n- Write it badly. Garbage draft. You can fix it later.\n- Change POV or tense temporarily.\n\n**\"I hate everything I've written\"**\n- Stop reading what you've written while drafting.\n- First drafts are supposed to be bad. That's their job.\n- Ask: what originally excited you about this story?\n\n**\"I'm bored with it\"**\n- If you're bored, the reader will be too. Something needs to change.\n- What do you actually want to write right now? Write that.\n- Add something unexpected.\n\n**\"I don't have time/energy\"**\n- Write for 10 minutes. Just 10.

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "How do I create tension?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "**Tension is the gap between what the reader expects/hopes and what happens.**\n\n**Techniques:**\n\n1. **Dramatic irony**\n   Reader knows something the character doesn't. We see the trap; they don't.\n\n2. **Time pressure**\n   A deadline creates automatic tension. Ticking clock, countdown, \"before the sun rises.\"\n\n3. **Stakes clarity**\n   We know exactly what happens if they fail. The worse the consequences, the higher the tension.\n\n4. **Close calls**\n   Almost caught. Almost fell. Almost discovered. The near-miss ratchets up fear for the next time.\n\n5. **Unresolved questions**\n   What's in the box? Who sent the note? Why is she lying? Humans need closure. Delay it.\n\n6. **Conflicting goals**\n   Character wants two incompatible things. Or two characters both want what only one can have.\n\n7. **Unreliable information**\n   Character might be wrong. Might be being manipulated. Reader doesn't know what's true.\n\n8. **Pacing**\n   Short sentences. Quick cuts. Tension in the prose itself.\n\n**What kills tension:**\n- Resolving things too quickly\n- Deus ex machina (easy escapes)\n- Stakes that don't feel real\n- Reader not caring about characters\n\nWhat scene are you trying to make tense?"}]}

Tension in shoulders. Hands that fidget or go still.\n\n2. **Specific details**\n   Not \"the room was messy\" but \"three coffee cups sat on the desk, one growing mold.\"\n\n3. **Dialogue**\n   Characters reveal themselves through what they say and how they say it.\n\n4. **Actions and choices**\n   What someone does defines them more than description.\n\n5. **Reactions**\n   Show how other characters respond to someone.\n\n**The test:**\nIf you cut the telling and kept only the showing, would the reader still understand?
