First drafts are supposed to be bad.\n\n**Specific techniques**:\n\n- Cut unnecessary words (\"in order to\" → \"to\")\n- Use active voice (\"The ball was thrown by John\" → \"John threw the ball\")\n- Vary sentence length\n- Show, don't tell\n- Avoid adverbs (often sign of weak verb)\n- Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing\n\n**Resources**:\n- \"On Writing Well\" by Zinsser\n- \"Elements of Style\" by Strunk & White\n- \"Bird by Bird\" by Anne Lamott\n- Hemingway Editor app\n\n**Mindset**: Everyone's first draft is terrible.

You should be able to identify speaker without tags.\n\n3. **Subtext**: People don't always say what they mean. What's unsaid is often more important.\n\n4. **Advance plot or reveal character**: Every line should do work. Cut small talk unless it serves purpose.\n\n5. **Use action beats**: Instead of \"said\" tags, show character doing something.\n\n**Mechanics**:\n- New paragraph for each speaker\n- \"Said\" is invisible - don't avoid it\n- Avoid adverbs in tags (\"said angrily\")\n- Use action to show emotion instead\n\n**Example**:\n\n\"I didn't know you were coming.\" She didn't look up from her book.\n\n\"Surprise.\" He set down his bag. \"You don't seem thrilled.\"\n\n\"I'm reading.\"\n\n\"Right.\" He stood there. \"Should I leave?\"\n\nThe page turned. \"Did I say that?\"\n\n---\nNotice: subtext, no adverbs, distinct voices, action instead of tags."}]}

Write a different scene. Outline more.\n\n**Not connected to material**: Lost interest? → Ask why. Find the spark or pivot.\n\n**Depleted**: Burnt out? → Rest. Input before output. Read.\n\n**Practical tactics**:\n\n- Write for 5 minutes. Just 5. Starting is the hardest part.\n- Lower the stakes: \"I'm just writing notes.\"\n- Change environment: New location, different device.\n- Write the easy part: Dialogue, scene you're excited about.\n- Talk it out: Describe what you're trying to write out loud.\n- Write about being blocked: Sometimes breaks the log jam.\n- Exercise: Physical movement helps mental stuck.\n\n**The truth**: Professionals write when they don't feel like it. Waiting for inspiration is a trap. Show up, produce imperfect words, fix them later."}]}
