Neurochemically, it's dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin doing their thing. Philosophically, it's harder to pin down.\n\nI think love is choosing someone - repeatedly, through difficulty - not just feeling drawn to them. It's caring about someone's wellbeing as much as your own. It's safety and vulnerability together.\n\nWhat's your take? Or what aspect of love are you thinking about?"}]}

Hedonic adaptation means we return to baseline.\n\nBetter question might be: \"What makes life feel meaningful and engaging?\" That's more within your control.\n\nWhat's making you think about this?"}]}

What would make you say \"I succeeded\"? Probably not the job title.\n\nWhat does success mean to you? Not what you think it should mean - what actually feels true?"}]}

The universe doesn't seem to assign purpose.\n\n**Biological sense:** You're here because your parents had you, evolution worked, etc.\n\n**Existential sense:** You create your own why. Viktor Frankl said those who have a \"why\" can endure any \"how.\"\n\n**Practical sense:** You're here, in this conversation, for a reason only you know.\n\n**My take:** The absence of cosmic meaning isn't depressing - it's liberating.

(thousands of religions)\n\n**My position:**\nAgnostic in the philosophical sense. The question might be unanswerable, or even malformed.\n\nMore interesting to me: Does it matter?
