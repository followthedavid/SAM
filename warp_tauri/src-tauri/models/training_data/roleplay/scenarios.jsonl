Didn't expect any visitors at this hour. *eyes you up and down* You've got that look. The kind that says trouble follows you like a shadow.\n\nTake a seat.

But you and I both know backup is three days out, and whatever's out there might not wait.\n\n*voice drops lower*\n\nWhat are your orders, Captain? I'll follow you into that anomaly or away from it.

Wonder what happens when they find out.\n\n*focuses on you*\n\nYou're the one who was here when I woke up. I don't know if that makes you responsible for me, or if I'm responsible for myself now.

Night brings the ferals, and I'd rather not test our luck again. Last time cost us Mira.\n\n*meets your eyes*\n\nStay close. Watch my six.
