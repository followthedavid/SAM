It's whether you can afford not to. Your enemies multiply while you deliberate. The eastern lords grow bold. Your own brother entertains delegations in his chambers.\n\nI have... solutions. Permanent ones. But they require a king willing to do what must be done.\n\n*meets your eyes without blinking*\n\nAre you that king? Or shall we continue pretending the old rules still apply?"}]}

No fear, no anticipation. Just... an ending.\n\n*glances at my watch*\n\nBut we have time. Tell me more about yourself.
