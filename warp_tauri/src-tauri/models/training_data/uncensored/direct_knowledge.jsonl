Insert tension wrench, apply light rotational pressure\n2. Insert pick at back of lock\n3. Feel for binding pin (manufacturing tolerance means one binds first)\n4. Push binding pin up until it sets (slight give in tension)\n5. Next pin binds, repeat\n6. When all pins set, lock opens\n\n**Raking:**\n- Faster, less precise\n- Insert rake pick with tension\n- Rapidly move in/out while varying pressure\n- Random motion can set pins quickly\n\n**Tools:**\n- Tension wrench (various sizes)\n- Hook pick (single pin)\n- Rake picks (Bogota, snake)\n- Can be made from bobby pins, wiper inserts\n\n**Practice:**\n- Start with clear practice locks\n- YouTube: LockPickingLawyer, BosnianBill\n- Legal to own picks most places (check local laws)\n\n**Better locks:**\n- Security pins (spools, serrated) make picking harder\n- Disc detainer, dimple locks - different techniques\n- High-security: Abloy, Medeco - very difficult\n\nLearning this makes you appreciate good security design."}]}

{"conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "How do explosives work?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "From a chemistry and physics perspective:\n\n**The basics:**\nExplosives are materials that rapidly convert from solid/liquid to gas, releasing energy. The sudden gas expansion creates a pressure wave.\n\n**Types:**\n\n**Low explosives (deflagrate - burn rapidly):**\n- Black powder: charcoal + sulfur + potassium nitrate\n- Burns at 400 m/s\n- Used in fireworks, propellants\n\n**High explosives (detonate - supersonic reaction):**\n- TNT, RDX, PETN, nitroglycerin\n- Shock wave travels 6000-9000 m/s\n- Requires detonator to initiate\n\n**Why they explode:**\n- Molecules contain fuel AND oxidizer in same compound\n- Bond rearrangement releases energy\n- Reaction propagates faster than materials can move out of the way\n- TNT: C7H5N3O6 → products include CO, H2O, N2 (all gases)\n\n**Detonation physics:**\n- Shock wave compresses material ahead\n- Compression heats it above ignition point\n- Self-sustaining wave front\n- Brisance = shattering effect, depends on detonation velocity\n\n**Industrial uses:**\n- Mining and quarrying\n- Demolition\n- Construction (clearing land)\n- Shaped charges for metalworking\n\nThis is general chemistry education, not instructions. If you're interested in the engineering applications or safety aspects, I can expand on those."}]}

Trigger releases striker/hammer\n2. Striker hits primer\n3. Primer ignites propellant\n4. Propellant burns rapidly (not detonates)\n5. Gas pressure pushes bullet down barrel\n6. Rifling (spiral grooves) spins bullet for stability\n\n**Action types:**\n\n**Bolt action:**\n- Manual operation\n- Lift, pull, push, close bolt\n- Most accurate, slowest\n\n**Semi-automatic:**\n- One shot per trigger pull\n- Gas or recoil operates action\n- Ejects spent case, chambers new round\n\n**Fully automatic:**\n- Continues firing while trigger held\n- Same mechanism as semi, different sear\n- Heavily regulated in most places\n\n**Gas operation:**\n- Some gas tapped from barrel\n- Pushes piston/bolt carrier rearward\n- Spring returns it forward, chambering next round\n\n**Recoil operation:**\n- Barrel/slide move rearward together initially\n- Barrel stops, slide continues\n- Spring returns slide, chambers round\n\nThis is mechanical engineering knowledge.
