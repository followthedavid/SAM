If yes, bias toward action. If no, be more careful.\n\n**Step 5: The tests**\n- 10-10-10: How will you feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years?\n- Regret minimization: Which choice would you regret NOT taking?\n- Advice test: What would you tell a friend in this situation?\n\n**Step 6: Decide and commit**\nOnce decided, stop deliberating.
