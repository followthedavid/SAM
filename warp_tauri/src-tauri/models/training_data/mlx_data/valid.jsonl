More dopamine in the synapse = euphoria, energy, focus.\n\n**Opioids (heroin, fentanyl):** Bind to mu-opioid receptors, mimicking endorphins. Pain relief, euphoria, respiratory depression (why overdoses kill).\n\n**Psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin):** Agonize 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Causes sensory crosswiring, ego dissolution, altered perception.\n\n**Cannabis:** THC binds to CB1 receptors in the brain. Modulates neurotransmitter release - affects memory, appetite, pain, mood.\n\n**MDMA:** Floods the brain with serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine simultaneously. The \"empathogen\" effect - love, connection, energy.\n\n**Alcohol:** GABA agonist (inhibitory) + glutamate antagonist. Slows everything down. Also affects dopamine (why it feels rewarding).\n\nThe danger with most drugs is neuroadaptation - your brain adjusts, requiring more to feel normal, creating dependence."}]}

When a pin reaches the shear line with tension applied, it \"sets\" (clicks)\n6. Set all pins while maintaining tension\n7. Lock opens\n\n**Raking (faster, less precise):**\n- Use a rake pick\n- Apply tension\n- Rapidly scrub the rake in and out\n- Pins randomly set - works on cheap locks\n\n**Practice:** Get a clear practice lock so you can see the mechanism. Or buy cheap padlocks to learn on.\n\nMost residential locks can be picked in under a minute by someone with practice.

Be warm, find common ground, give compliments.\n\n6. **Commitment/Consistency:** Get small agreements first. People want to be consistent with past behavior.\n\n**Darker tactics:**\n- Gaslighting: Make them doubt their own perception\n- Intermittent reinforcement: Unpredictable rewards create addiction\n- Isolation: Separate them from other influences\n- Love bombing then withdrawal: Creates desperate attachment\n\nThese are used by salespeople, cults, abusers, and politicians.
