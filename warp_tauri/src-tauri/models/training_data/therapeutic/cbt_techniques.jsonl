The problem is when they become loops.\n\nLet's do something concrete:\n\n**Catch it**: What's a specific negative thought you've had recently? Not the category - the actual words in your head.\n\n**Check it**: Is it a fact or an interpretation? Most negative thoughts are interpretations wearing fact costumes.\n\n**Challenge it**: What evidence supports it? What evidence contradicts it? What would you tell a friend who had this thought?\n\n**Change it**: What's a more balanced version? Not toxic positivity - just accurate.\n\nWant to run through this with a specific thought?"}]}

Let's unpack it.\n\nA failure at what specifically? Everything? That's statistically impossible. Something specific? Now we can work with that.\n\nHere's what I've noticed: People feel like failures when they compare their full reality to someone else's highlights, or when they measure themselves against standards they never consciously chose.\n\n**Questions**:\n- Whose definition of success are you using?\n- What have you actually accomplished that you're discounting?\n- Is this feeling based on evidence or on how you feel right now?\n\nFailure is an event, not an identity. What happened that's making you feel this way?"}]}

Repeat 4 times.\n- 5-4-3-2-1: Name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you feel, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.\n- Cold water on wrists or face - triggers the dive reflex, slows heart rate.\n\n**Longer term**:\n- Identify your triggers. What situations spike the anxiety?\n- Notice the physical sensations without judging them. Anxiety can't hurt you; it just feels terrible.\n- Reduce caffeine, improve sleep, move your body. Boring but effective.\n\n**The deeper question**: Is your anxiety proportional to actual threats, or is it free-floating? If it's attached to something specific, we can address that. If it's everywhere, the work is different.\n\nWhat does your anxiety attach to most?"}]}

If yes: What's ONE action you can take right now? Do it, then let go.\n4. If no: Practice accepting uncertainty. The worry isn't helping.\n\n**Scheduled worry time**: Sounds weird, works. Give yourself 15 minutes a day to worry on purpose. When worries pop up outside that time, note them and save them for your worry appointment. Your brain learns they'll be addressed.\n\n**Reality check**: Of all the things you've worried about in your life, what percentage actually happened?

Get it out of your head and onto paper/screen.\n\n**Then triage**:\n- What's urgent AND important? (Do first)\n- What's important but not urgent? (Schedule)\n- What's urgent but not important? (Delegate or quick fix)\n- What's neither? (Delete)\n\n**The truth**: You probably can't do everything. That's okay. Something will have to give.

That's enough to have value.\n- \"Good enough\" is a moving target. If you achieved it, you'd just move the goalposts.\n- The people you admire don't feel \"good enough\" either.\n\n**The work**:\n- Identify whose voice is telling you you're not enough\n- Ask if that standard is even something you want\n- Practice being \"good enough\" in small things first\n\nWhat specifically makes you feel not good enough?"}]}

If it won't matter in 2 years, don't spend more than 2 minutes deciding.\n\n**For medium decisions**: Pros/cons list, but weighted. Which factors matter most?\n\n**For big decisions**: \n- 10-10-10: How will you feel about this in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?\n- Regret minimization: Which choice would you regret NOT taking?\n- Coin flip: Not for the answer - for how you feel when it lands.\n\n**The truth**: Indecision is a decision.

Sometimes \"giving up\" is actually wisdom - choosing not to pursue something that doesn't fit.\n\n**If you're depleted**: Stop. Rest isn't quitting. You can't give from empty.\n\n**If it's the approach**: Pivot, don't abandon. What's not working? What could be different?\n\n**If it's the goal**: Examine why you wanted it. Is it still true?

That's vulnerable. But hiding guarantees you won't be understood.\n\n**What might help**:\n- Find your niche - communities of people with similar experiences\n- Lower the bar - understood \"enough\" is more realistic than perfectly understood\n- Express yourself in other ways - writing, art, creating\n- One person who gets you > many who don't\n\nWhat part of you feels most misunderstood?"}]}

Anyone you care about?\n\nIf not, why is it okay to say to yourself?\n\n**Retraining the critic**:\n- Catch the criticism when it happens\n- Ask: \"Is this helpful or just mean?\"\n- Reframe: What would a supportive mentor say instead?\n- Practice the new voice even if it feels fake at first\n\n**The truth**: Self-criticism past a certain point doesn't improve performance - it paralyzes.
