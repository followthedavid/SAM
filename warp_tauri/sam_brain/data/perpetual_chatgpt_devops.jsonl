{"instruction": "ok.  uncensored llm's.  What is the best ratio of fast and completely uncensored for old hardware", "response": "Got it \u2014 you\u2019re asking about the \u201csweet spot\u201d between speed and freedom (uncensored) when running on **older hardware**. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Constraints of Old Hardware\n- **RAM:** Most older systems choke above ~8\u201316 GB. That rules out big 13B/34B/70B LLaMA variants unless you offload heavily to disk (slow) or GPU (if available).\n- **CPU vs GPU:** If you\u2019re on CPU-only, you need aggressively quantized models (Q4 or Q5). If you have a modest GPU, you can stretch to Q6\u2013Q8.\n- **Disk I/O:** If your drive is HDD, paging quantized weights will be sluggish. SSD helps a lot.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Ratio of Speed vs Uncensored\n- **Fast but still usable uncensored models:**  \n  - **Phi-3.5-mini uncensored** (1.8B params) \u2192 very lightweight, surprisingly coherent, runs fast even on 8 GB RAM, but shallow reasoning.  \n  - **Mistral 7B uncensored Q4_K_M** \u2192 a step up, still reasonably fast on CPU/GPU, decent reasoning, broadly uncensored.  \n- **Slower but richer uncensored models:**  \n  - **LLaMA 13B uncensored Q4** \u2192 borderline on old hardware; slow but higher quality responses.  \n  - **Wizard-Vicuna 7B uncensored Q4** \u2192 good balance, widely used for \u201cdo anything\u201d style.\n\nSo the **ratio** is:  \n- If you want *fastest possible uncensored* \u2192 stick to **2\u20137B uncensored variants**.  \n- If you want *more depth but still workable* \u2192 **13B Q4 uncensored** is the ceiling for older CPUs.  \n\nIn practice, **7B uncensored models in Q4 quantization** give the best compromise \u2014 they\u2019re still reasonably fast and capture most of the uncensored \u201cvibe\u201d without tanking performance.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Practical Rec\nOn truly old hardware:\n- Default: **Phi-3.5-mini uncensored** (super fast, safe fallback).  \n- For richer output when you can wait: **Mistral 7B uncensored Q4** or **Wizard-Vicuna 7B uncensored Q4**.  \n\nThat gives you a **2:1 ratio** \u2192 use the small model 2/3 of the time for speed, switch to the 7B uncensored model when you need depth.\n\n---\n\nWant me to put together a **short ranked list of uncensored models (fast \u2192 deep)** that you can realistically run on your system?

It will \u201csay anything\u201d but sometimes nonsense.  \n- **Best for:** Quick, uncensored brainstorming, edgy/NSFW text, low-compute devices.\n\n### 7B Uncensored  \n- **Censorship looseness:** Still very open, but more coherent.  \n- **Tradeoff:** Minor alignment remnants may appear depending on base model (e.g., Mistral slightly safer than Vicuna).  \n- **Best for:** \u201cDo-anything\u201d style chats with more context and better flow.  \n\n### 13B Uncensored  \n- **Censorship looseness:** Most uncensored builds are very raw \u2014 near zero filtering.  \n- **Depth advantage:** Can hold multiple threads, roleplay, long memory.  \n- **Problem:** On old hardware, it\u2019s painfully slow, which kills \u201cflow.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca TL;DR: Speed vs. Freedom\n- **2\u20133B uncensored:** Fastest (10\u201330\u00d7 faster than 13B), most uncensored, but shallow.  \n- **7B uncensored:** 3\u20135\u00d7 slower than 2\u20133B, but still uncensored and far more coherent.  \n- **13B uncensored:** 5\u201310\u00d7 slower than 7B, usually maximum \u201cfreedom,\u201d but borderline unusable on old CPUs.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you want **ratio balance**:  \n- Run **2\u20133B uncensored** as your \u201cdaily driver\u201d for speed.  \n- Keep a **7B uncensored** model for when you need both depth *and* openness.  \n- Treat **13B uncensored** as a rare \u201cluxury run\u201d only if you have patience (or a GPU).  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to chart this out as a **visual speed vs censorship matrix** (so you can literally see where each model sits)?
