Your receiver compares to current time. Time difference \u00d7 speed of light = distance.\n\n**Why atomic clocks matter:**\nLight travels ~300,000 km/s. A microsecond error = 300m position error. Satellites have atomic clocks. Your phone doesn't, so it uses math with 4+ satellites to correct.\n\n**Relativity correction:**\nSatellites move fast (time dilation: -7 \u03bcs/day) and are in weaker gravity (general relativity: +45 \u03bcs/day).

Meanwhile, confident idiots are certain they're geniuses (Dunning-Kruger effect).\n\n**The paradox**:\nIf you were actually incompetent, you wouldn't worry about it. Your anxiety about not being good enough is actually evidence that you ARE good enough to see gaps in your knowledge.\n\n**What helps**:\n\n**1.

You type google.com in browser\n2. Computer asks DNS server: \"What's the IP for google.com?\"\n3. DNS server responds: \"172.217.14.206\"\n4. Browser connects to that IP address\n5.

You can play without it - many great musicians learn by ear. But theory helps you: communicate with other musicians, understand WHY things sound good, compose and improvise, learn new music faster. It's like grammar - you can speak without knowing grammar terms, but it helps. Start with basics: major scale, intervals, building chords, common progressions (I-IV-V-I).

Have a fallback**: On bad days, a 10-minute walk still counts.\n\n**What to do**:\n\nSimple starting point:\n- 2-3x week of something that raises your heart rate (cardio)\n- 2-3x week of something that uses your muscles (strength)\n- Daily movement (walking, stretching)\n\nYou don't need a perfect program.
